                                Faure Chomón joined the fight against Batista on March 10, 1952. He was a tireless organizer of the fighters of the Revolutionary Directorate in the streets of Havana and Head of Action of that Organization. He was one of the main organizers of the assault on the Presidential Palace on March 13, 1957 and second in command of the assault command on that military fortress. In the initial moments of the fierce combat, he was shot in two parts of his body -when he tried to cross the entrance gate to the Palace-, but he survived and managed to save his life with the help of one of those heroic combatants. <br> After Palacio, still without recovering from his injuries, Faure Chomón continued the clandestine struggle in Havana with his fierce comrades to reorganize the Revolutionary Directorate. Later, Fructuoso Rodríguez -in the brief time that he was Secretary General of the Organization- appointed him to travel abroad and organize an expedition that would bring weapons and war supplies to continue the clandestine struggle in Havana and constitute a guerrilla front in the center of the Island. This mission was organized and successfully carried out abroad by Faure Chomón; who at the command of a group of heroic combatants landed in Nuevitas on February 8, 1958 and, with the help of the combatants of the Directory in the cities of Nuevitas, Camagüey, Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Spíritus and Havana, managed to carry the important and voluminous caches of weapons and supplies without any setback to Havana and to the Escambray, respectively. <br>
                                <br>Perhaps the Nuevitas expedition and the arrival in Havana and the Escambray of the men of the Revolutionary Directorate carrying such a valuable arsenal of weapons, has been the most successful insurrectionary operation that was organized in Cuba against the Fulgencio Batista dictatorship. for
                                <br> At the beginning of March 1958, Commander Faure Chomón del Escambray marched again to Havana with the purpose of organizing and participating in another armed uprising that the Revolutionary Directorate proposed to carry out in the capital of the country and that, together with the convocation of a revolutionary general strike that was projected, created the necessary conditions to achieve the overthrow of the dictatorship. However, that purpose was frustrated as the valuable shipment of weapons brought to Havana was captured by the dictatorship police and the men of the Directorate were virtually unarmed and then they could not carry out the armed uprising in the capital, nor participate in the April strike together with the M-26-7, because they considered that the strike had to be supported by well-armed men. <br>
                                <br>After the failed attempt at an armed uprising in Havana and the failure of the April Strike, Commander Faure Chomón reorganized the Revolutionary Directorate in the capital and in June 1958 he marched to the city of Sancti Spíritus, in the province of Las Villas, city ​​in which the command of the Revolutionary Directorate was located in that province. for
                                <br> Already at that time the betrayal of Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo and Armando Fleites to the Revolutionary Directorate and the delivery of the Second National Front of the Escambray -founded and constituted by DR 13M- to authenticism, by virtue of the proselytizing work developed by Plinio, was evident Prieto -testaferro of Carlos Prío Socarrás- within the members of the guerrilla front in Escambray. for
                                <br> On July 10, 1958, Commander Faure Chomón returned to Escambray, took command of the guerrilla forces loyal to his Organization and wrote glorious pages again; not only as a combatant, but also as a political and military strategist in his revolutionary unity agreements with Commander Ernesto Che Guevara, which favored the combatants of Column No. 8 of the July 26 Movement under the command of Che Guevara and those of the Column of the Revolutionary Directorate under the command of Faure Chomón, to fight together under a single command during the Final Offensive in Las Villas, which began on December 15, 1958. They, together with Column No. 2 of M-26-7, commanded the Commander Camilo Cienfuegos, liberated one by one in close combat almost all the cities of the province, including Yaguajay, Trinidad and Santa Clara, the last bastions of the Batista dictatorship to offer resistance to the rebels. <br>
                                <br>The Liberation of the Villas in the center of the Island was a decisive blow for the dictator Fulgencio Batista to leave power and leave the country during the night of December 31, 1958; on the eve of the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, on January 1, 1959. <br>
                                <br> Furthermore, upon the triumph of the Revolution, the July 26 Movement excludes the leaders of the March 13 Revolutionary Directorate from the main military commanders in the country and from senior positions in the Revolutionary Government. This caused that in the first days of January 1959 there were disagreements and tension between both revolutionary organizations. This situation increased after the speech given by the Commander-in-Chief upon his arrival in Havana on January 8, 1959, when he blamed the men of the Revolutionary Directorate for taking some weapons from a military fortress and placing them in different parts of the city. capital for unknown purposes. for
                                <br> However, in a very few days the links between DR 13M and M-26-7 were reestablished, which made it possible for the combatants of both organizations to walk the path of revolutionary unity that demanded the historical moment that our country was living. country. for
                                <br> Commander Faure Chomón's life story is complemented by his political work after January 1959 as founder of the ORI, the PURS, the PCC and as a deputy to the National Assembly of People's Power; having had the honor of being the first ambassador of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba in the former Soviet Union; later his intense and fruitful work as Minister of Communications and Transportation; after having been for ten years First Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba in Las Tunas, a territory where he left indelible marks of economic and social progress widely recognized by all its inhabitants. Finally, the life story of Commander Faure Chomón is made up of his love for the Revolution, for socialism, his modesty, simplicity and austerity in his personal and family life and his dedication for more than sixty years to disseminating the passages of his revolutionary life to transmit that historical legacy to the new generations of Cubans, especially to the members of the FEU and the UJC who have always been united by fraternal and fluid personal relationships. <br>
